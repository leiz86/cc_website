#### Graph Representation Learning Network via Adaptive Sampling [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04637)]

Graph representation is an important topic in academic research as well as in industry. Better graph representations can help improve user social-interaction modelling, recommendation, as well as bringing domain-specific knowledge to content understanding. Here we present a recent research work that achieves the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation for link-prediction, as well as node classification in an inductive setting.

### Explore Multilingual Syntactic Sentence Representations [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11768)]

Attention based language models like the Transformer and BERT gained a lot of popularity. Their representations served as panacea for downstream NLP tasks. These models capture rich semantics, however their abilities to capture syntax are less known to us. In the industry, for very specific applications, we may want representations that only capture syntax. Having representations with rich semantic information means that subsequent models could be biased to certain topics or vocabulary.

Furthermore, a lot of industrial projects are constrained by time and resources. Training with multiple GPUs for a couple of weeks may not be a realistic approach for an experimental project, as many modern language models are known for their number of parameters and training time.

Perhaps, we want simpler and smaller models that can possibly capture the syntactic structure in dense representations 
and do the job.

### DENS: A Dataset for Multi-class Emotion Analysis [[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11769)]

As a storytelling platform, we believe humans connect with stories through emotions. It is hard to believe that not a lot of research has been focused on understanding narrative emotions, especially in modern writings. Here, we introduced a new dataset for multi-class emotion analysis from long-form narratives in English as a first step to understand emotions within stories.
